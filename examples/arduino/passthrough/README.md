# Arduino Passthrough

This is a simple example of an OpenTherm passthrough that can be used to log OpenTherm data. This is mainly intended as a testing and debugging aid, not for production data logging. If your intent is to continuously log data from your existing thermostat and boiler, consider using [OpenTherm Gateway](https://otgw.tclcode.com/) instead, as it is much more mature and feature rich.
